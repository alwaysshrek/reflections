What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros are that you can choose when you want to commit logically instead of depending on
some software to do it for you. This bunches changes logically instead of being bound to
a time bound interval.
Cons are that its dependent on the human memory which can be non-trustworthy unless one
makes a good habit out of it.
