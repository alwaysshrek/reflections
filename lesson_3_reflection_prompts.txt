When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working in a team or you are working with multiple computers/locations, then
remote repository makes sense. This allows to make changes from multiple locations and keep
it all in one place and possibly in sync.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
 up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Since you want to preserve your local changes against automatic updates. You should only 
 manually pull for the exact same reason.
