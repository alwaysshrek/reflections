What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a directory as a git repository, git creates a .git 
directory which it uses to store the snapshot of the repository. Its needed
to track the repository changes with git by way of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains the files which you want to track as part of the 
coming commit. It offers the value of bunching together changes to different 
files as part of one logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can run git diff with various options to make sure that the change done is
as per what you want. git diff without any arguments compares the working and the
staging directory. With --staged option, it compares the staging and the commit1.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when you want to do changes off-hand without touching the 
master version. They help to keep one version stable while still allowing to
change files to test future changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams allow you to see the child to parent structure as well as the branching 
out of various branches.
