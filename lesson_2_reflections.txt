What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a directory as a git repository, git creates a .git 
directory which it uses to store the snapshot of the repository. Its needed
to track the repository changes with git by way of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains the files which you want to track as part of the 
coming commit. It offers the value of bunching together changes to different 
files as part of one logical change.
