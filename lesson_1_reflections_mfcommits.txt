Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because one logical change can span multiple files rather than one, so in that case
it makes sense to save all the files which have changed together. Google Docs on the 
other hand works per file so it may not recognize the automatic change.
