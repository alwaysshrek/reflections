How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Since version control maintains changes between each logical change, you can be sure that whatever
was done can be rolled back using a combination of git checkout to a previous state and going
up one commit state every time. This way you can check what changed between each commit states
and the bugs, if any can be found/removed.
