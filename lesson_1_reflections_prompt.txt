How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff command, with the -u prompt shows the names of the old and the new files
(with symbols) along with the contextial differences around the difference. The diff showed
exactly the typo of "space" and "spacr" thus helping to find the bug in the new js script.
